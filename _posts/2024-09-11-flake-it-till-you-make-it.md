title: Could Trump's avoidance of substantial commentary on North Korea signal a shift in the importance of the issue for U.S. foreign policy, or was it a strategic omission?

Trump's avoidance of substantial commentary on North Korea could reflect multiple layers of strategic thinking or shifting priorities. Here are a few potential interpretations:

1. **Strategic Omission**: Trump might have chosen to downplay North Korea to avoid giving the regime undue attention or to prevent escalating tensions. By not engaging deeply, he could be aiming to keep North Korea's actions from becoming a focal point in U.S. foreign policy discussions, perhaps to avoid provocation or to keep the regime uncertain about U.S. responses.

2. **Shift in Priorities**: Itâ€™s also possible that Trump's focus was directed toward other foreign policy concerns or domestic issues. If other matters, like trade or military engagements in other regions, were more pressing, North Korea might have naturally taken a back seat in his commentary.

3. **Diplomatic Strategy**: Avoiding detailed commentary might also be part of a broader diplomatic strategy. By not revealing too much, Trump could be attempting to maintain flexibility in negotiations or avoid committing to specific positions that might limit his options.

4. **Personal Preference or Style**: Trump's approach to foreign policy was often characterized by unconventional methods and a preference for high-profile negotiations and direct engagement. His limited commentary on North Korea could reflect a personal or stylistic choice rather than a significant policy shift.

Each of these angles offers a plausible explanation, and the true motive might combine elements from several of them.
